//! Shared code generation logic for buffa.
//!
//! This crate takes protobuf descriptors (`google.protobuf.FileDescriptorProto`,
//! decoded from binary `FileDescriptorSet` data) and emits Rust source code
//! that uses the `buffa` runtime.
//!
//! It is used by:
//! - `protoc-gen-buffa` (protoc plugin)
//! - `buffa-build` (build.rs integration)
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The code generator is intentionally decoupled from how descriptors are
//! obtained. It receives fully-resolved `FileDescriptorProto`s and produces
//! Rust source strings. This means:
//!
//! - It doesn't parse `.proto` files.
//! - It doesn't invoke `protoc`.
//! - It doesn't do import resolution or name linking.
//!
//! All of that is handled upstream (by protoc, buf, or a future parser).
